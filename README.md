# Recent Software Licenses for SLM

## Description

Part of my website admin duties with the <a href="https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/software-license-manager/">Software License Manager</a> plugin was to be able to quickly see what licenses have been recently created, and sometimes get quick access to the associated user account.

I created the plugin to make the process easier. Feel free to do with it as you please.

## Installation

1. Upload `recent-software-licenses-for-slm` folder (or just the `recent-software-licenses-for-slm.php` file) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the <strong>Plugins</strong> menu in WordPress.

## How to use

1. Go to the admin dashboard to see the widget. Click on a users' name to get to their account page.

## License

GPLv2 or later
